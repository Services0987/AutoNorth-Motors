# AutoNorth Motors — PRD

## Original Problem Statement
Build a highly powerful, automated lead and deal generation platform for vehicle dealerships. Requirements:
- Single/multi-page website to list cars
- Track user intent/visits, capture leads, message them
- Ultra-premium, luxurious UI (dark theme #050505, gold accents #D4AF37, 3D effects/animations)
- Intelligent AI chatbot to converse with visitors and book test drives
- Top-tier SEO setup
- Easy-to-use admin panel with CSV upload for inventory
- Remove "Made with Emergent" branding
- First-person viewpoint 3D effects like gaming websites
- Fonts large enough to read

## Architecture
- **Frontend**: React 18, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, react-parallax-tilt, react-helmet-async
- **Backend**: FastAPI + Motor (async MongoDB), emergentintegrations for AI chatbot
- **Database**: MongoDB (motor async driver)
- **AI**: emergentintegrations SDK (Emergent LLM key) for AI chatbot
